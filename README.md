# SipScore - Your Local Coffee Review Guide

Welcome to SipScore! This project is designed to help coffee enthusiasts find the best coffee spots in their local area. With SipScore, you can discover hidden gems, read reviews, and explore the best coffee experiences nearby.

## Getting Started with Vite + React

SipScore is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and lightweight build tool, along with [React](https://react.dev/), a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This setup allows for hot module replacement (HMR), providing a seamless development experience.

### Plugins Used

SipScore uses two key plugins to support React development with Vite:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Utilizes [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for fast refresh, allowing you to see changes in real-time during development.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) to achieve fast refresh with an alternative approach to Babel.

Both plugins support hot reloading and offer various configuration options to suit your development needs.

## Project Goals

SipScore aims to:

- Provide a platform for discovering the best coffee in the local area.
- Enable users to submit reviews and ratings for their favorite coffee shops.
- Offer a clean, user-friendly interface for exploring and finding new coffee spots.
